#+TITLE: My Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Alexey Shiklomanov

The core of the configuration is stored and described in [[configuration.org]].
Highlights include:

- Literate configuration file with ~org-mode~, which makes it easier to navigate and document.
- [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][ESS]] mode for vim keybindings. Mode specific keys are handled by [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]].
- Heavily customized [[https://github.com/emacs-ess/ess][ESS]] configuration, since most of my work is in R
